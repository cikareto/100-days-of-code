### Day 2: June 18, Tuesday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** 
- Read the artical about [MicroFrontend](https://micro-frontends.org/)
- Solved coding problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) 

**Thoughts:** I have to find some artical or interesting technology to present on the team workshop this friday. I think I will go with Microfrontend, so I try to understand thier definition and tmr I will go through the code!

### Day 3: June 19, Wednesday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** 
- Continue Read the artical about [MicroFrontend](https://micro-frontends.org/), involved coding part.

**Thoughts:** Got confused when talking about backend part. Not fully understand how each component comunicate together. Maybe on this weekend I should try more on backend first. 

### Day 4: June 20, Thusday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** 
- Conclude [MicroFrontend](https://micro-frontends.org/) to prepare for my workshop presentation.

### Day 7: June 24, Monday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Redesigned UI and prepared base components

### Day 8: June 25, Tuesday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Connected [cikareto.github.io](https://github.com/cikareto/cikareto.github.io) with Github API to get all my repositories. But I got the error when try to render about your Object is invalid.

**Thoughts:** I think I know its cause, will figure out tmr. It's should be something about state, isn't it?

### Day 9: June 26, Wednesday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Fixed yesterday problem about fetching data by using redux thunk to handle this. Tmr will continue with UI.

**Thoughts:** Don't fully understand what redux-thunk is. Will go into details tmr.
