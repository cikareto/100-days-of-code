# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 16, Sunday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Get started with Docker.

**Thoughts:** I try to understand concept of Docker and played around with its commands. Still a lot of things that I need to know :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

**Link(s) to work:** 
1. [Hello Docker](https://github.com/cikareto/hello-docker)
2. [Hello Docker Compose](https://github.com/cikareto/hello-docker-compose)
3. [Docker vs Docker Compose](https://medium.com/@salisa.cct/docker-vs-docker-compose-c3ac6a1f0cd1)

### Day 1: June 17, Monday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** 
- Watched [One Day Builds: Instagram Clone Using Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2uEfOls4e4) 
- Solved coding problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) 

**Thoughts:** 
- Flutter look so fun. I should try something like this next time.
- I need to improve my logic a lot. Still get stucked on [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/submissions/) 

### Day 2: June 18, Tuesday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** 
- Read the artical about [MicroFrontend](https://micro-frontends.org/)
- Solved coding problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) 

**Thoughts:** I have to find some artical or interesting technology to present on the team workshop this friday. I think I will go with Microfrontend, so I try to understand thier definition and tmr I will go through with the code!
